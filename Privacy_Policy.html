    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p><small>Last updated: 4 December 2025</small></p>

    <p>
      This website is operated by <strong>The citizens'/owners’ rights</strong>.  
      It is a static site that offers free PDF documents and optional donations via Ko-fi and Buy Me a Coffee (BMC), which use Stripe for payment processing.
    </p>

    <h2>Information Collected</h2>
    <p>
      We do not run our own tracking scripts or analytics on this website.
      However, the following information may be collected:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Visit data:</strong> The hosting provider (e.g. GitHub Pages) may log technical data such as IP address,
        browser type and access time as part of normal server operation.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Donation data:</strong> If you make a voluntary donation via Ko-fi or BMC, those services and Stripe may collect
        your name or username, email address, payment details and donation amount.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      We only see the limited donor information shown in the Ko-fi / BMC / Stripe dashboards (for example: name or username,
      optional message, and amount). We do <strong>not</strong> receive or store your full payment card details.
    </p>

    <h2>Use and Disclosure of Information</h2>
    <p>
      We use the information available to us only to:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>operate the website and provide the free documents, and</li>
      <li>receive and manage voluntary donations.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Information is shared with third-party services only as necessary for these purposes, in particular:
      the hosting provider (for serving the site), Ko-fi and BMC (for donations), and Stripe (for payment processing).
      We do not sell or rent your personal data.
    </p>

    <h2>Security</h2>
    <p>
      Payments are processed securely by Ko-fi, BMC and Stripe over encrypted connections (HTTPS).
      We do not process or store payment card information on this website.
      Access to our accounts with these services is protected with strong passwords and, where available, two-factor authentication.
